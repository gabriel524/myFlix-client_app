# myFlix-client
 For this application, I will be using React as a framework to build the client-side for an application called myFlix-client which is based on an existing server-side code with a REST API and database. Note that this application is a single page application (SPA) that uses a routing state to navigate between views and sharing URLs. 

 Note: The application in this project is still undergoing development process thus, there will be constance updates and modification for the code and project in general.
